# Volleyball Schedule and Map
This is a GUI that computes a schedule for the MV volleyball league. One playdate has three teams participating. Each team has to play against their opponents exactly two times. 
You can enter the data for all teams as well as the number of teams in the league. Based on that, the program will show you the schedule.
You can also open a map where the arrival routes are shown. It is possible to zoom in or go north/east/west/south. 
If you do not know how to use the GUI, there is a help button with instructions. 
You need QtCreator and C++.
